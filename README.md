- 👋 Hi, I’m @pcwhite
- 👀 I’m professionally interested in coding, testing, and automation in full-stack Software Engineering, as well as unprofessionally into other hobbies including piano, ultimate frisbee and dad jokes (think i'm losing money with that last one).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS and TS, API development, React and advanced integration using Behavior Driven Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation solutions, Cucumber frameworks and other JS and Web related projects.
- 📫 How to reach me?  You can email me at philupthecup87@gmail.com
